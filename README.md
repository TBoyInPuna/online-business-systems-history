# Online Business Systems (San Francisco)
## An IBM Mainframe Service Bureau and Its CICS and WYLBUR Systems (1973–1982)

This repository contains a technical and historical recollection of **Online Business Systems (OBS)**, a San Francisco–based IBM mainframe service bureau that operated during the 1970s and early 1980s.

The document focuses on the period **1973–1982** and describes:

- The OBS **CICS V1**–based multi-tenant transaction processing system  
- The **WYLBUR/MILTEN** environment used for development and operations  
- The **IBM System/370** operating environment (MFT, MVT, VS1, SVS, MVS, HASP/JES2)  
- The architecture of a **multi-client service bureau** before CICS/VS  
- The **Princess Cruises reservation system** and other client systems  
- The engineering, systems, and operations organization that supported a **24×7 production data center**

This is not a corporate history written from surviving records. It is a **first-hand technical and operational recollection** by a member of the system software group, supplemented where necessary by clearly labeled second-hand background.
